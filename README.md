# Top_X_NBA_Webscrape
Project to learn python web-scraping libraries.

This program makes a csv file of the top NBA players by points scored during the post season or regular season of any year from 2001-Present. It also lets you choose how big of a list you want to see. 

When you run app.py an input prompt window opens. This window asks you to enter a year between 2001-Present, the character "R" or "P" for regular or postseason, and the number of entries you want to see. Pressing search updates the file titles "stats.csv". 


Improvement Ideas: 

1. Use the column data to make a pandas dataframe. This would allow for the players to be sorted by assits,rebounds etc.
2. Make a dropdown menue that has options for different stats. This would allow a person to see just 3 pointers and 3 point percentage instead of steals (should they wish to do search that).
